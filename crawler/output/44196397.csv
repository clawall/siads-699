"Posted June 13, 2021",@elonmusk,False,Elon Musk,"@ajtourville Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal (usually high strength steel). 

Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM, as carbon sleeve (mostly) stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration."
"Posted June 13, 2021",@elonmusk,False,Elon Musk,"@ajtourville Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load. Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation.

Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion. 

Preload is also helpful for maintaining precise gap to stator."
